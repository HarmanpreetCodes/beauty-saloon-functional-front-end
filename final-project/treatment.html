    <h3>Browtint</h3>
    <p>If you're dealing with thin, sparse brows, eyebrow gels and pencils are ace at getting you fuller, more defined arches. However, the results are short-lived, which is why many have turned to eyebrow tinting as an alternative, proclaiming the service as nothing short of life-changing. In 10 to 15 minutes, patchy eyebrows are transformed into something that could challenge even Brooke Shields's iconic set

<h3>Brow-extension</h3>
<p>Much like lash extensions, brow extensions revolve
     around the concept of attaching fibers with a 
     clear medical-grade adhesive to achieve a lengthening effect. 
     But that’s where the similarities end. “With lash extensions, you 
     need natural eyelashes to attach the extension to,” Richardson says. “But with eyebrow extensions, the actual fibers are attached directly to the skin or the eyebrow hair itself.”</p>

<h3>Lash-extension</h3>
<p>Eyelash extensions are semi-permanent fibers that are attached to your natural eyelashes in order to make your lash fringe look longer, fuller, and darker. Individual lash extensions are applied to each of your individual natural eyelashes (one extension per natural eyelash) using a semi-permanent glue.</p>
